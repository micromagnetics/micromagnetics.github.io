title: Publication on spin-diffusion algorithm
---

The preprint of our manuscript entitled "Self-consistent micromagnetic simulations including spin-diffusion effects" is now available on arXiv ([arXiv:1410.6067](http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6067)).
In this work present the spin-diffusion algorithm implemented in [magnum.fe](http://micromagnetics.org/magnum.fe) and perform numerical experiments comparing the model to the spin-torque model by Slonczewski as well as the model by Zhang and Li.
