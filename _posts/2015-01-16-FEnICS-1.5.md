title: magnum.fe update for FEniCS 1.5
---

We update magnum.fe to work with FEniCS 1.5 which was released this week.
Most notable changes of the new release are:

* The exchange-field computation is pulled in the `ExchangeField` class
* The newly introduced point-integral measure is now used for nodewise operations
* A `Timer` class is introduced for basic profiling

See the [documentation](http://micromagnetics.org/magnum.fe) for more details.
