title: 70 lines of NumPy
---

We present a very concise but complete micromagnetic finite-difference code in only 70 lines of NumPy (without comments).
The code can be found on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/micromagnetics/70LinesOfNumpy).
A description of the project is available on arXiv ([arXiv:1411.7188](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7188)).
