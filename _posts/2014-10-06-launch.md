Welcome to micromagnetics.org. We are a group of scientists from the Vienna University of Technology that develop micromagnetic simulation software. Here we want to share the progress of software development and additional information of micromagnetics.

For an introduction to the theory of micromagnetism, see [Micromagnetism](/micromagnetism).

For information on our simulation software, see [Software](/software).
