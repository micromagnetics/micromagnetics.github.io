title: Status of magnum.fe
---

Since our last post, [magnum.fe](magnum.fe) has evolved quite a bit.
However, we currently do not have the resources the maintain the open source version, so we decided to officially pause the development of the open-source branch.

The closed-source version works with the latest version of FEniCS (2016.2) and has some exciting new features, e.g.

* Self-consistent spin diffusion that solves for electric potential and spin accumulation
* Spin-Hall and inverse spin-Hall effect
* Oersted field
* String method solver for energy-barrier calculations
* Slonczewski spin-torque
* Zhang and Li spin-torque
* Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction

If you are interested in the full-featured version of magnum.fe, please feel free to [contact us](about) so we can provide you with an evaluation copy.
Note that we updated the [manual](magnum.fe) that now includes the documentation of the commercial version of magnum.fe.
