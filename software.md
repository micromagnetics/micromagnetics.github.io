magnum.fe is a finite-element package for the solution of dynamical micromagnetic problems.
It is written in Python and C++ and largely relies on the multi purpose finite-element library [FEniCS](http://fenicsproject.org/).
For the solution of open-boundary problems a hybrid FEM/BEM method is implemented that uses the [BEM++](http://www.bempp.org/) library.
magnum.fe is free software and can be extended to your needs.
